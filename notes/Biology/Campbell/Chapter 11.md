# CONCEPT 11.3: Signal transduction: Cascades of molecular interactions transmit signals from receptors to relay molecules in the cell

- When receptors for signaling molecules are plasma membrane proteins, the transduction stage of cell signaling is usually a <font color = 'red'>multistep pathway </font>involving many molecules.
## Signal Transduction Pathways

- Binding of signaling molecules to a receptor in the plasma membrane triggers the first step in the signal transduction pathway—the chain of molecular interactions that leads to a particular response within the cell.

## Protein Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation

- Phosphorylation of proteins and its reverse, dephosphorylation, are commonly used in cells to regulate protein activity. 
- An enzyme that transfers phosphate groups from ATP to a protein is generally known as a **protein kinase**.

- **Protein phosphatases**, enzymes that can rapidly remove phosphate groups from proteins, a process called *dephosphorylation*.
- Phosphatases provide the mechanism for turning off the signal transduction pathway when the initial signal is no longer present.

## Small Molecules and Ions as Second Messengers

- Many signaling pathways also involve small, nonprotein, water-soluble molecules or ions called **second messengers**.
- Because they are small and water-soluble, they can readily spread through regions of the cell by diffusion.
- Second messengers participate in pathways that are initiated by both G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases.
- The two most common second messengers are cyclic AMP and calcium ions, $\text{Ca}^{2+}$.

### *Cyclic AMP*

- Earl Sutherland found that binding of epinephrine to the GPCR in the plasma membrane results in a rise in the cytosolic concentration of **cyclic AMP**(cAMP; *cyclic adenosine monophosphate*).

- Adenylyl cyclase (also known as adenylate cyclase), converts ATP to cAMP in response to an extracellular signal.
- It does not persist for long in the absence of the hormone because a different enzyme, called phosphodiesterase, converts cAMP to AMP.
- Many other signaling molecules that lead to activation of adenylyl cyclase by G proteins and formation of cAMP.

### ***Calcium Ions and Inositol Trisphosphate*** ($\text{IP}_3$)

- Many of the signaling molecules that function in animals induce responses in their target cells through signal transduction pathways that increase the cytosolic concentration of calcium ions.

- The $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration in the cytosol is usually much lower than in the extracellular fluid and ER. Protein pumps in the plasma membrane and the ER membrane, driven by ATP, move $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ from the cytosol into the extracellular fluid and into the lumen of the ER.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- In response to a signal relayed by a signal transduction pathway, the cytosolic calcium level may rise, by a mechanism that releases $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ from the cell’s ER.
- The pathways leading to calcium release involve two other second messengers, **inositol trisphosphate** ($\text{IP}_3$) and diacylglycerol ($\text{DAG}$).
