# CONCEPT 11.3: Signal transduction: Cascades of molecular interactions transmit signals from receptors to relay molecules in the cell

- When receptors for signaling molecules are plasma membrane proteins, the transduction stage of cell signaling is usually a <font color = 'red'>multistep pathway </font>involving many molecules.
## Signal Transduction Pathways
- Binding of signaling molecules to a receptor in the plasma membrane triggers the first step in the signal transduction pathwayâ€”the chain of molecular interactions that leads to a particular response within the cell.
