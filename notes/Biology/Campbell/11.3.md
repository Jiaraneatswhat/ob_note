# CONCEPT 11.3: Signal transduction: Cascades of molecular interactions transmit signals from receptors to relay molecules in the cell

- When receptors for signaling molecules are plasma membrane proteins, the transduction stage of cell signaling is usually a <font color = 'red'>multistep pathway </font>involving many molecules.
## Signal Transduction Pathways

- Binding of signaling molecules to a receptor in the plasma membrane triggers the first step in the signal transduction pathway—the chain of molecular interactions that leads to a particular response within the cell.

## Protein Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation

- Phosphorylation of proteins and its reverse, dephosphorylation, are commonly used in cells to regulate protein activity. 
- An enzyme that transfers phosphate groups from ATP to a protein is generally known as a **protein kinase**.

- **Protein phosphatases**, enzymes that can rapidly remove phosphate groups from proteins, a process called *dephosphorylation*.
- Phosphatases provide the mechanism for turning off the signal transduction pathway when the initial signal is no longer present.

## Small Molecules and Ions as Second Messengers

- Many signaling pathways also involve small, nonprotein, water-soluble molecules or ions called **second messengers**.
- Because they are small and water-soluble, they can readily spread through regions of the cell by diffusion.
- Second messengers participate in pathways that are initiated by both G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases.
- The two most common second messengers are cyclic AMP and calcium ions, $\text{Ca}^{2+}$.
