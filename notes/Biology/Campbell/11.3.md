# CONCEPT 11.3: Signal transduction: Cascades of molecular interactions transmit signals from receptors to relay molecules in the cell

When receptors for signaling molecules are plasma membrane proteins, like most of those we have discussed, the transduction stage of cell signaling is usually a <color = 'red'>multistep pathway involving many molecules
